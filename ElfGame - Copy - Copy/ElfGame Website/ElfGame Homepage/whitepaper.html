                    <p style="margin-top: 5%;">Phase1
                        We plan to release the Contracts to the public 2 or3 days before the MINT (together with the Airdrop).
                        If some community members wish, we are pleased to explain every single detail of the contract and its security measures/mechanics.
                        We will take every single criticism and suggestions serious.
                        The actual MINT and the release of the game will be on the same day. Also, the liquidity pool.
                        
                        Phase1.5
                        Different additions to the game (new item's) that improve the game.
                        
                        Phase 2.0 
                        There will be a focus on the Marketing of the Project in order to boost OS sales and keep the Liquidity pool healthy, and also prepare for SEASON 2 of the game. 
                        In this phase also several changes will be done for the % of OS Royalties (we are looking even up to 100% of the royalties from all present collections(invites and magic wand included)). 
                        Please don't understand this wrong, we are NOT going to modify the % for the resales on OS but the % which we add to the liquidity pool.
                        
                        Phase 2.5 
                        Launch of season 2 (we want to keep the details of the game secret for now at least, all thou you should know that we are already working on it).
                        
                        Phase 3
                        Once we have both Seasons up and running, we will focus on Marketing (depending on the actual situation of active members, maybe we will not need any kind of marketing and can focus on further updates).
                        
                        Phase 4
                        We are planing to implement our $Mana token for "special" uses, maybe even RL uses (of course it depends all on the Country people are from due to different laws and regulation's regarding Crypto),
                        which is also the main goal of the project, and that is passive income and actual utility.
                        Of course, many factors are going to be present during the whole "adventure" and we truly hope everything goes like we planned (mathematically and technically speaking).
                        
                        Summary:
                        Simply said, we want to make a cool looking Stake2Earn NFT which brings you passive income, has some utility and DOESNT relate to "pump and dump".
                        Regarding the contract, is it made in the way that people cannot exploit the token or the pool and has different mechanics to AVOID the so-called "pump and dump"
                        
                        We are hoping for the best and looking forward towards a bright future.</p>
